Authenticity Classification of Tweets

The focus of the project is on determining whether tweets are "Real" or "Not Real."

"Real": These are tweets that are authentic, meaning they genuinely come from users and represent real opinions or information. They aren't misleading, deceptive, or generated by bots.

"Not Real": These tweets are likely inauthentic, potentially generated by bots, spreading misinformation, or otherwise not genuinely representing real user opinions.
